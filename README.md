This repo is managed using LabVIEW 2013 SP1.

## Current branch
The current branch for this repo is ```SE_package```. It's being used to create the Staab Engineering version of STM. ```master``` is being preserved for fork/pull merges with NI's repository.

## Developer README
The /dependencies folder contains packages and other dependencies that you must install before opening the source code for this project. One of them uninstalls STM (NI distro or SE distro) so you don't accidentally link code to vi.lib while developing.
